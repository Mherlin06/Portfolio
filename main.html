            <h2>Some words about me ...</h2>
            <p>
                " I'm a father who enjoys giving life to his ideas with code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I first discovered programming during my first year in college, back in 2010.
                I was in mathematics class, and our teacher showed us this game he created using Perl.
                That was just a simple game, a 1v1 space war with tanks, but i was 100% amazed!
                "How can he do that on is own?" I was hooked.
            </p>
            <p>
                I jumped right into it, learning basics, creating some "magic number" algorithm, building small pages,
                my funny resume, and more with HTML, CSS. But unfortunately, that is as far as it went.
                I had to stop school and earn some money to live. So, i had less time to learn and i let programming aside. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I took the first job that came to me and started to work at this fast-food, the one with the yellow "M". 
                I learned team management naturally with practice. Worked on other restaurants, to finally become executive assistant.
            </p>
            <p>    
                But you know what? I met my wife, friends, and found another passions. 
                We began to travel starting with France, our own country. Then Europe, Asia, North America, all around the world. 
                Those trips lasted for days, then weeks, till complete month. We also took a huge amont of photography along the way, getting technically better everytime. 
                At some point, we had a new adventure coming ... And this baby girl, is just a pure ball of energy and smiles! 
            </p>
            <p>
                But, then Covid hit and suddenly i had more time. So, i started learning again. Specifically, i learned web and mobile development, as i had things i wanted to build myself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After a few months of self-teaching, i knew this was what i wanted to do for my career. 
                So, i quited my job and put my heart and soul into it. I was coding every day, late into the nights, and on weekends. 
                Until i was ready to join the 3W-Academy bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm now seeking an apprenticeship contract where i can contribute with my skills and knowlegdge to help a company achieve their goals. 
                Also working alongside senior developers will help me raise my standards about Web development expectations. "
